# An-EDA-of-Public-Transport
An Exploratory Data Analysis of Public Transportation to compare passenger usage patterns, compare operational efficiency across transport modes.PROJECT 4 

# Introduction
In today's urban environments, public transportation plays a major role in shaping the efficiency, accessibility, and sustainability of city life. Understanding how, when, and where commuters interact with transit systems is essential for data-driven decision-making and service optimization. This project with Metro Move Transit Solutions presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aimed at uncovering insights from public transport trip data across multiple modes: buses, trains, ferries, and trams.

The core objective of this analysis is to explore passenger usage patterns, compare operational efficiency across transport modes, and identify performance gaps and anomalies that could hinder service delivery. By leveraging descriptive statistics, visualizations, univariate, bivariate and multivariate techniques, this study highlights key factors influencing transit demand, trip durations, fare dynamics, and daily usage trends.
Through this EDA, strategic recommendations are provided to enhance scheduling, optimize fleet allocation, and support fare policy reforms. The analysis serves as a foundational step toward building smarter, more responsive transit systems that align with commuter behavior and operational goals.

# Project Aims
The primary aim of this project was to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on public transportation trip data to support data-driven improvements in transit operations. Specifically, the project focused on the following goals:
•	Understand Passenger Behavior: Identify when, where, and how passengers use different modes of transportation (buses, trains, ferries, and trams) by analyzing trip frequency, timing, and location data.
•	Evaluate Operational Efficiency: Compare performance metrics such as trip duration, fare amount, and passenger count across various transport modes to assess service effectiveness and identify areas for optimization.
•	Uncover Demand Patterns: Reveal temporal and spatial trends in trip data to support better scheduling and resource allocation, including variations by day of the week and time of day.
•	Detect Anomalies and Inconsistencies: Identify irregularities in trip data that may indicate issues such as underutilized services, inefficient routes, pricing anomalies, or scheduling gaps.
•	Support Strategic Recommendations: Use insights from the analysis to suggest actionable improvements in transit planning, fare standardization, and service delivery.

# Summary of Impact 
The data analysis conducted on public transportation operations provided critical insights into passenger behaviour, mode efficiency, and operational performance across buses, ferries, trams, and trains. By evaluating trip volumes, durations, and fare structures, the project identified peak travel periods, most-used transport modes, and high-traffic locations such as Downtown, Central, and the Airport. Key findings showed that buses and ferries dominate passenger usage, with peak activity during weekends and evening hours.

The study also revealed pricing inconsistencies, particularly with ferry services, and uncovered underutilized but efficient modes like trams, suggesting opportunities for operational improvements and service promotion. Additionally, predictive modeling using machine learning highlighted the importance of specific features (e.g., transport mode, communication dates) in forecasting lead conversion, though challenges with data completeness affected model reliability.
Overall, the analysis supports data-driven decisions for optimizing service allocation, pricing strategies, and customer engagement, contributing to a more efficient and responsive public transportation system.

# Conclusion and Recommendation 
This analysis of public transportation data uncovered key insights into passenger behaviour, modal efficiency, and fare dynamics. Buses are the most utilized mode, particularly on weekends, while trams, although the least used; offer the most time-efficient service. Fare inconsistencies were noted with ferries, and Thursdays showed unusually long trip durations. To improve operations, it is recommended to optimize bus services during peak periods, promote tram adoption, review ferry pricing, and investigate scheduling issues on Thursdays. Additionally, aligning fleet size with demand and deploying real-time analytics tools can enhance transit planning and service delivery.
